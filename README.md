**Proteomic dynamic of the cnidarian extracellular matrix during development** <br>
_Abstract:_ While the cellular process and dynamics during development have received much attention over the years, the influence of the extracellular matrix (ECM) on developmental processes remains largely unknown. Cnidarians are the earliest animals that possess all core components of the animal ECM combined with their simple body plan and complex, multi-stage life cycles they are ideal model organisms to study the developing ECM. We present the first proteomic map of the ECM the sea anemone throughout multiple stages of its complex life cycle. Through quantitative proteomic studies of the isolated ECM from larvae, primary polyp and adult we identified both all structural and solved proteins that make up the ECM during development. We identified more than 50 candidates that are differentially detected throughout development. Among these a number of functionally undescribed proteins. Based on these candidates we currently perform knockdown screens to identify ECM components that are important for development. We use custom antibodies as well as elasticity measurements using atomic force microscopy to measure the morphological and physical effect of the knockdowns and correlate these to the observed developmental phenotypes.<br>
