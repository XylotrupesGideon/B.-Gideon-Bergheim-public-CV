### Extracurricular Courses/Workshops

#### **Leadership/Management**

With the prospect of either leading a scientific group or a multidisciplinary team in industry I have sought tries to learn as much as possible about leadership and project management.

- Project Management IPMA Basic certificate [] - October 2022
- Project Management in Pharma and Biotech [[Certificate-English]](./Certificates/Projektmanagment%20in%20Biotech%20and%20Pharma_Bergheim.pdf) - May 2022

- Leadership skills for young scientists [[Certificate-English]](./Certificates/GA_Leadership%20skills_Bergheim.pdf) - November 2020

#### **Science Communication**

Science has to be communicated to reach is full potential. Early on in my scientific career I therefore strived to learn how to effectively communicate scientific results to diverse audiences.

- How to design scientific figures [[Certificate-English]](./Certificates/GA_Scientific%20Figures_Bergheim.pdf) - February 2021
- Science communication workshop [[Certificate-English]](./Certificates/Workshop_Philipp_Campbell_Science%20Communication.pdf):
  - Publishing, editing and authorship. - May 2019
  - Multidisciplinarity and Computer Science. - May 2019
  - Researchers communication, public perception and public trust. - May 2019
- Presentation skills for high potential young master scientists. [[Certificate-German]](./Certificates/Presentation_Style.pdf) - March 2017

#### **Teamwork**

The psychology and sociology of teams has always been fascinating to me. Especially the intercultural aspect and inter-team conflict management were therefore topics I decided to learn in parallel to my scientific education.

- Intercultural competences and diversity management [[Certificate-German]](./Certificates/Interkulturelle%20Kompetenz_Bruno%20Gideon%20Bergheim_heiSKILLS.pdf) - June 2022
- Managing conflicts [[Certificate - English]](./Certificates/GA_Managing%20Conflicts_Bergheim.pdf) - October 2020
- Team communication - Key roles and intercultural contexts [[Certificate-English]](./Certificates/GA_Team_communication_Culture.pdf) - August 2019

#### **Computer skills**

While I am self taught in most of my computer skills I learned the importance of knowing well structured approaches to development. Therefore, I decided to learn the important skills in the form of a structured course.

- Scientific Software Development [[Certificate-English]](./Certificates/Scientific%20Software%20development.pdf) - March 2022

#### **Other**

- Design Thinking [[Certificate-German] ](./Certificates/Design%20Thinking_Bergheim%2C%20Bruno%20Gideon.pdf) - May 2020

## University Engagement

**Alumni teach useful skills; Workshop series**<br>
After finishing my master studies I organized multiple workshops for fellow master students in which former students of the developmental and stem cell biology major program taught valuable skills they learned during or after their master studies to the younger students.

**Major Studies Student Speaker** _(October 2016 - April 2019)_<br>
As Major speaker I represented the students of the developmental and stem cell biology major. In this function I also helped to organize the BioSpective talk series which had the aim to showcase career options outside of academia.

## Other

**Administrator/Head of Staff** @[Build the Earth](https://buildtheearth.net) _(January 2021 - today)_<br>
The Build the Earth gaming community is an international online community with ~300.000 members. They are dedicated to replicate the whole earth at 1:1 scale in the computer game Minecraft and thereby make the whole world accessible for any child that owns the game. As Head of Staff I am the responsible HR manager for the staff team of ~100 volunteers. I am also one of the five main administrators that act as senior management for the overall project.

**Voluntary social service year** @[ICYE/Uganda Volunteers for Peace](https://www.icye.org/icye-in-the-world/uganda/) _(August 2011 - August 2012)_<br>
For my volunteer social service year I went to Uganda to work at the Kiyumbakimu Childrens Village, home for AIDS-orphans. Sponsored by a "weltwärts" scholarship. [[Certificate-German]](./Certificates/Zertifikat_ICJA.pdf)
